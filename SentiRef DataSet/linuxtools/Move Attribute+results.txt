117 commit e4b973120d7b935bf3a579119a1047c0f7fca0ed bug 496922 - improvements on the 'push image' dialog refactored the imagepushpage to use jface databinding replaced button with link to open registry account prefs added options to tag with 'force' flag and to keep the tagged image upon completion. refactored imagepushpage and imagepullpage to use the same base wizardpage to share the ui part that provides the registry selection and addition. added swtbot tests, refactored registryaccountmanager by introducing a registryaccountstoragemanager that can be replaced during tests. changed the validation in the registrydialog to allow for null username/password since this should not be a requirement for pulling images (eg: dockerhub or other public registries) checks the name of the image before tagging. checks if the selected registry provides auth before pushing. display push progress handlers in the progress view only. change-id: i682b2cdace11c7124be691186ed31ea41741e2ba signed-off-by: xavier coulon  xcoulon@redhat.com  reviewed-on: https://git.eclipse.org/r/76610 tested-by: hudson ci reviewed-by: jeff johnston  jjohnstn@redhat.com  	117 commit e4b973120d7b935bf3a579119a1047c0f7fca0ed bug 496922 - improvements on the 'push image' dialog refactored the imagepushpage to use jface databinding replaced button with link to open registry account prefs added options to tag with 'force' flag and to keep the tagged image upon completion.<br> refactored imagepushpage and imagepullpage to use the same base wizardpage to share the ui part that provides the registry selection and addition.<br> added swtbot tests, refactored registryaccountmanager by introducing a registryaccountstoragemanager that can be replaced during tests.<br> changed the validation in the registrydialog to allow for null username/password since this should not be a requirement for pulling images (eg: dockerhub or other public registries) checks the name of the image before tagging.<br> checks if the selected registry provides auth before pushing.<br> display push progress handlers in the progress view only.<br> change-id: i682b2cdace11c7124be691186ed31ea41741e2ba signed-off-by: xavier coulon  xcoulon@redhat.<br>com  reviewed-on: https://git.<br>eclipse.<br>org/r/76610 tested-by: hudson ci reviewed-by: jeff johnston  johnstn@redhat.<br>com 	2	-1	 117[0] commit[0] e4b973120d7b935bf3a579119a1047c0f7fca0ed[0] bug[0] 496922[0] improvements[1] on[0] the[0] 'push[0] image'[0] dialog[0] refactored[0] the[0] imagepushpage[0] to[0] use[0] jface[0] databinding[0] replaced[0] button[0] with[0] link[0] to[0] open[0] registry[0] account[0] prefs[0] added[0] options[0] to[0] tag[0] with[0] 'force'[0] flag[0] and[0] to[0] keep[0] the[0] tagged[0] image[0] upon[0] completion[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] refactored[0] imagepushpage[0] and[0] imagepullpage[0] to[0] use[0] the[0] same[0] base[0] wizardpage[0] to[0] share[0] the[0] ui[0] part[0] that[0] provides[0] the[0] registry[0] selection[0] and[0] addition[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] added[0] swtbot[0] tests[0] refactored[0] registryaccountmanager[0] by[0] introducing[0] a[0] registryaccountstoragemanager[0] that[0] can[0] be[0] replaced[0] during[0] tests[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] changed[0] the[0] validation[0] in[0] the[0] registrydialog[0] to[0] allow[0] for[0] null[0] username/password[0] since[0] this[0] should[0] not[0] be[0] a[0] requirement[0] for[0] pulling[0] images[0] eg[0] dockerhub[0] or[0] other[0] public[0] registries[0] checks[0] the[0] name[0] of[0] the[0] image[0] before[0] tagging[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] checks[0] if[0] the[0] selected[0] registry[0] provides[0] auth[0] before[0] pushing[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] display[0] push[0] progress[0] handlers[0] in[0] the[0] progress[0] view[0] only[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] i682b2cdace11c7124be691186ed31ea41741e2ba[0] signed[0] off[0] by[0] xavier[0] coulon[0] xcoulon@redhat[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] reviewed[0] on[0] https[0] ://git[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] eclipse[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] org/r/76610[0] tested[0] by[0] hudson[0] ci[0] reviewed[0] by[0] jeff[0] johnston[0] jjohnstn@redhat/johnstn@redhat[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-1 max of sentences]]]
