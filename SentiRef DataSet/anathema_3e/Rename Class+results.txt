179 commit 875bce60c41f923ccd90695e51da409e9256e829 some significant refactoring to special charms: * we want to differentiate between special charms that affect learning (the original intention) from those that simply apply some mechanical effects (the new ox-body). * remove no longer necessary special charm learning types for ox-body and pain tolerance. * add some support for mechanical effects that don't need their own learning model. still a little too bound to special learning charms for my tastes; will review. * implementing new ox-body granting health levels based on stamina. * todo: repurchases of ox-body do not currently grant health levels. * todo: tests. 	179 commit 875bce60c41f923ccd90695e51da409e9256e829 some significant refactoring to special charms: * we want to differentiate between special charms that affect learning (the original intention) from those that simply apply some mechanical effects (the new ox-body)<br> * remove no longer necessary special charm learning types for ox-body and pain tolerance.<br> * add some support for mechanical effects that don't need their own learning model.<br> still a little too bound to special learning charms for my tastes; will review.<br> * implementing new ox-body granting health levels based on stamina.<br> * todo: repurchases of ox-body do not currently grant health levels.<br> * todo: tests.	2	-4	 179[0] commit[0] 875bce60c41f923ccd90695e51da409e9256e829[0] some[0] significant[0] refactoring[0] to[0] special[1] charms[1] we[0] want[0] to[0] differentiate[0] between[0] special[1] charms[1] that[0] affect[0] learning[0] the[0] original[0] intention[0] from[0] those[0] that[0] simply[0] apply[0] some[0] mechanical[0] effects[0] the[0] new[0] ox[0] body[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] remove[0] no[0] longer[0] necessary[0] special[1] charm[1] learning[0] types[0] for[0] ox[0] body[0] and[0] pain[-3] tolerance[1] [[Sentence=-4,2=word max, 1-5]] add[0] some[0] support[0] for[0] mechanical[0] effects[0] that[0] don't[0] need[0] their[0] own[0] learning[0] model[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] still[0] a[0] little[0] too[0] bound[0] to[0] special[1] learning[0] charms[1] for[0] my[0] tastes[0] will[0] review[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] implementing[0] new[0] ox[0] body[0] granting[0] health[0] levels[0] based[0] on[0] stamina[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] todo[0] repurchases[0] of[0] ox[0] body[0] do[0] not[0] currently[0] grant[0] health[0] levels[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] todo[0] tests[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-4 max of sentences]]]
