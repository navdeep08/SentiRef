4040 commit 85553cf5cbcf320e168a8e43573f40b474d01d88 v2 cleaner, easily testing, shared memory and distributed gatk job management. serious unit testing. very much cleaner processing. some code cleanup remains in removing now unused classes but the system is ready for general testing. confirmed that one can run the ug 100 ways parallel without error, but edge cases may remain. see documentation at: http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/parallelism_and_the_gatk#distributed_parallelism_.28experimental.29 for examples on how to run this, or the testing scala script 	4040 commit 8553cf5cbcf320e168a8e43573f40b474d01d88 v2 cleaner, easily testing, shared memory and distributed gatk job management.<br> serious unit testing.<br> very much cleaner processing.<br> some code cleanup remains in removing now unused classes but the system is ready for general testing.<br> confirmed that one can run the ug 100 ways parallel without error, but edge cases may remain.<br> see documentation at: http://w.<br>broadinstitute.<br>org/gsa/wiki/index.<br>php/parallelism_and_the_gatk#distributed_parallelism_.28experimental.29 for examples on how to run this, or the testing scala script	1	-2	 4040[0] commit[0] 85553cf5cbcf320e168a8e43573f40b474d01d88/8553cf5cbcf320e168a8e43573f40b474d01d88[0] v2[0] cleaner[0] easily[0] testing[0] shared[0] memory[0] and[0] distributed[0] gatk[0] job[0] management[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] serious[-1] unit[0] testing[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] very[0] much[0] cleaner[0] processing[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] some[0] code[0] cleanup[0] remains[0] in[0] removing[0] now[0] unused[0] classes[0] but[0] the[0] system[0] is[0] ready[0] for[0] general[0] testing[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] confirmed[0] that[0] one[0] can[0] run[0] the[0] ug[0] 100[0] ways[0] parallel[0] without[0] error[0] but[0] edge[0] cases[0] may[0] remain[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] see[0] documentation[0] at[0] http[0] ://www/://w[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] broadinstitute[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] org/gsa/wiki/index[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] php/parallelism_and_the_gatk#distributed_parallelism_[0] .28experimental[0] .29[0] for[0] examples[0] on[0] how[0] to[0] run[0] this[0] or[0] the[0] testing[0] scala[0] script[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-2 max of sentences]]]
6920 commit 70059a0fc95f5fa707d0ac76c319bf562ac9511f refactored joint estimation model to allow subclasses to overload pofd calculation over all frequencies. pooled model now takes only 20% of time that it used to. added integration test for pooled model and updated other joint estimation tests to be more comprehensive now that they are faster. 	6920 commit 70059a0fc95f5fa707d0ac76c319bf562ac9511f refactored joint estimation model to allow subclasses to overload pofd calculation over all frequencies.<br> pooled model now takes only 20% of time that it used to.<br> added integration test for pooled model and updated other joint estimation tests to be more comprehensive now that they are faster.	1	-1	 6920[0] commit[0] 70059a0fc95f5fa707d0ac76c319bf562ac9511f[0] refactored[0] joint[0] estimation[0] model[0] to[0] allow[0] subclasses[0] to[0] overload[0] pofd[0] calculation[0] over[0] all[0] frequencies[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] pooled[0] model[0] now[0] takes[0] only[0] 20%[0] of[0] time[0] that[0] it[0] used[0] to[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] added[0] integration[0] test[0] for[0] pooled[0] model[0] and[0] updated[0] other[0] joint[0] estimation[0] tests[0] to[0] be[0] more[0] comprehensive[0] now[0] that[0] they[0] are[0] faster[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
