3683 commit 8c262eb605ae1bb3f2766c1fadde1096ae2789c2 initial commit of new likelihood model to evaluate indel quality. principle is simple, a plain pair hmm with affine gap penalties (in log space) that does quasi-local alignment between reads and candidate haplotypes and which in theory should be more solid and more reliable than the older dindel-based model. it also allows to be easily extensible in the future if we decide to introduce either context-dependent and/or read-dependent gap penalties. model is disabled by default and we're still using the old dindel model until i'm more confident that new model is a definitive improvement, so right now this is enabled by hidden command line arguments, and it's not to be used yet. in detail: a) several refactorings to share softmax() available to other modules, so its now part of mathutils. b) refactored a couple of read utilities and moved from baq to readutils. c) new pairhmmindelerrormodel class implementing new likelihood model d) several new hidden debug arguments in uac. 	3683 commit 8c262eb605ae1bb3f2766c1fadde1096ae2789c2 initial commit of new likelihood model to evaluate indel quality.<br> principle is simple, a plain pair hm with affine gap penalties (in log space) that does quasi-local alignment between reads and candidate haplotypes and which in theory should be more solid and more reliable than the older dindel-based model.<br> it also allows to be easily extensible in the future if we decide to introduce either context-dependent and/or read-dependent gap penalties.<br> model is disabled by default and we're still using the old dindel model until i'm more confident that new model is a definitive improvement, so right now this is enabled by hidden command line arguments, and it's not to be used yet.<br> in detail: a) several refactorings to share softmax( available to other modules, so its now part of mathutils.<br> b) refactored a couple of read utilities and moved from baq to readutils.<br> c) new pairhmmindelerrormodel class implementing new likelihood model d) several new hidden debug arguments in uac.	2	-2	 3683[0] commit[0] 8c262eb605ae1bb3f2766c1fadde1096ae2789c2[0] initial[0] commit[0] of[0] new[0] likelihood[0] model[0] to[0] evaluate[0] indel[0] quality[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] principle[0] is[0] simple[0] a[0] plain[0] pair[0] hmm/hm[0] with[0] affine[0] gap[0] penalties[0] in[0] log[0] space[0] that[0] does[0] quasi[0] local[0] alignment[0] between[0] reads[0] and[0] candidate[0] haplotypes[0] and[0] which[0] in[0] theory[0] should[0] be[0] more[0] solid[0] and[0] more[0] reliable[0] than[0] the[0] older[0] dindel[0] based[0] model[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] it[0] also[0] allows[0] to[0] be[0] easily[0] extensible[0] in[0] the[0] future[0] if[0] we[0] decide[0] to[0] introduce[0] either[0] context[0] dependent[-1] and/or[0] read[0] dependent[-1] gap[0] penalties[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] model[0] is[0] disabled[0] by[0] default[-1] and[0] we're[0] still[0] using[0] the[0] old[0] dindel[0] model[0] until[0] i'm[0] more[0] confident[1] that[0] new[0] model[0] is[0] a[0] definitive[0] improvement[1] so[0] right[0] now[0] this[0] is[0] enabled[0] by[0] hidden[0] command[0] line[0] arguments[-1] and[0] it's[0] not[0] to[0] be[0] used[0] yet[0] [[Sentence=-2,2=word max, 1-5]] in[0] detail[0] a[0] several[0] refactorings[0] to[0] share[0] softmax[0] available[0] to[0] other[0] modules[0] so[0] its[0] now[0] part[0] of[0] mathutils[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] b[0] refactored[0] a[0] couple[0] of[0] read[0] utilities[0] and[0] moved[0] from[0] baq[0] to[0] readutils[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] c[0] new[0] pairhmmindelerrormodel[0] class[0] implementing[0] new[0] likelihood[0] model[0] d[0] several[0] new[0] hidden[0] debug[0] arguments[-1] in[0] uac[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-2 max of sentences]]]

4157 commit cba18116e4dbb56c6ce91f8c6b5de70959d9842e a significant refactoring of the rod system, done largely to simplify the process of streaming/piping vcfs into the gatk. notable changes: - public interface to rmdtrackbuilder is greatly simplified; users can use it only to build rmdtracks and lookup codecs. - roddatasource and rmdtrack are no longer functionally at the same level; roddatasources now manage rmdtracks on behalf of the gatk, and the only direct consumers of the rmdtrack class are the walkers that feel the need to access the rod system directly. (we need to stamp out this access pattern. a few minor warts were introduced as part of this process, labeled with todos. these'll be fixed as part of the vcf streaming project. 	4157 commit cba18116e4dbb56c6ce91f8c6b5de70959d9842e a significant refactoring of the rod system, done largely to simplify the process of streaming/piping vcfs into the gatk.<br> notable changes: - public interface to rmdtrackbuilder is greatly simplified; users can use it only to build rmdtracks and lookup codecs.<br> - roddatasource and rmdtrack are no longer functionally at the same level; roddatasources now manage rmdtracks on behalf of the gatk, and the only direct consumers of the rmdtrack class are the walkers that feel the need to access the rod system directly.<br> (we need to stamp out this access pattern.<br> a few minor warts were introduced as part of this process, labeled with todos.<br> these'll be fixed as part of the vcf streaming project.	3	-1	 4157[0] commit[0] cba18116e4dbb56c6ce91f8c6b5de70959d9842e[0] a[0] significant[0] refactoring[0] of[0] the[0] rod[0] system[0] done[0] largely[0] to[0] simplify[0] the[0] process[0] of[0] streaming/piping[0] vcfs[0] into[0] the[0] gatk[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] notable[0] changes[0] public[0] interface[0] to[0] rmdtrackbuilder[0] is[0] greatly[2] simplified[0] users[0] can[0] use[0] it[0] only[0] to[0] build[0] rmdtracks[0] and[0] lookup[0] codecs[0] [[Sentence=-1,3=word max, 1-5]] roddatasource[0] and[0] rmdtrack[0] are[0] no[0] longer[0] functionally[0] at[0] the[0] same[0] level[0] roddatasources[0] now[0] manage[0] rmdtracks[0] on[0] behalf[0] of[0] the[0] gatk[0] and[0] the[0] only[0] direct[0] consumers[0] of[0] the[0] rmdtrack[0] class[0] are[0] the[0] walkers[0] that[0] feel[0] the[0] need[0] to[0] access[0] the[0] rod[0] system[0] directly[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] we[0] need[0] to[0] stamp[0] out[0] this[0] access[0] pattern[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] a[0] few[0] minor[0] warts[0] were[0] introduced[0] as[0] part[0] of[0] this[0] process[0] labeled[0] with[0] todos[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] these'll[0] be[0] fixed[0] as[0] part[0] of[0] the[0] vcf[0] streaming[0] project[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[3,-1 max of sentences]]]
