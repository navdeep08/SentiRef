2748 commit efc0792e8851b2d3c8c76750876dc9549774bace refactored so that the actual multicone cone queries are done by an external object implementing the new coneresultrowsequence interface. this opens the way to provide a parallel (multi-thread) implementation of that interface, though currently only a sequential one is provided. 	2748 commit efc0792e8851b2d3c8c76750876dc9549774bace refactored so that the actual multicone cone queries are done by an external object implementing the new coneresultrowsequence interface.<br> this opens the way to provide a parallel (multi-thread) implementation of that interface, though currently only a sequential one is provided.	1	-1	 2748[0] commit[0] efc0792e8851b2d3c8c76750876dc9549774bace[0] refactored[0] so[0] that[0] the[0] actual[0] multicone[0] cone[0] queries[0] are[0] done[0] by[0] an[0] external[0] object[0] implementing[0] the[0] new[0] coneresultrowsequence[0] interface[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] opens[0] the[0] way[0] to[0] provide[0] a[0] parallel[0] multi[0] thread[0] implementation[0] of[0] that[0] interface[0] though[0] currently[0] only[0] a[0] sequential[0] one[0] is[0] provided[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
4769 commit 670c5aa41bc81ee39b452d39328b805dfb2dd23c refactored fits table serialization. fitstableserializer is now an interface rather than a concrete class, and it is implemented by both standardfitstableserializer and colfitstableserializer. 	4769 commit 670c5a41bc81ee39b452d39328b805dfb2dd23c refactored fits table serialization.<br> fitstableserializer is now an interface rather than a concrete class, and it is implemented by both standardfitstableserializer and colfitstableserializer.	1	-1	 4769[0] commit[0] 670c5aa41bc81ee39b452d39328b805dfb2dd23c/670c5a41bc81ee39b452d39328b805dfb2dd23c[0] refactored[0] fits[0] table[0] serialization[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] fitstableserializer[0] is[0] now[0] an[0] interface[0] rather[0] than[0] a[0] concrete[0] class[0] and[0] it[0] is[0] implemented[0] by[0] both[0] standardfitstableserializer[0] and[0] colfitstableserializer[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
6138 commit 3a6157d4ff42d4f765e118d704be5d59dd91e47b several changes connected with adopting the task package into ttools. mostly these are redesigns of features that i didn't like the look of when i came to look at it again a couple of years after first writing task. the main things are: - environment is now not an attribute of a parameter, you need to pass an environment to a parameter to get its value. the effect will usually be the same, but it makes explicit the fact that the parameter does not know its value outside of an execution environment of some kind. - environment setparametervalue and clearparametervalue have been renamed to acquirevalue and clearvalue, which i think are much less confusing. - thrown exceptions have been simplified - the only(?) checked exception declared by an interface is taskexception. - parameter now has a usage string. 	6138 commit 3a6157d4ff42d4f765e118d704be5d59dd91e47b several changes connected with adopting the task package into tools.<br> mostly these are redesigns of features that i didn't like the look of when i came to look at it again a couple of years after first writing task.<br> the main things are: - environment is now not an attribute of a parameter, you need to pass an environment to a parameter to get its value.<br> the effect will usually be the same, but it makes explicit the fact that the parameter does not know its value outside of an execution environment of some kind.<br> - environment setparametervalue and clearparametervalue have been renamed to acquirevalue and clearvalue, which i think are much less confusing.<br> - thrown exceptions have been simplified - the only(<br> checked exception declared by an interface is taskexception.<br> - parameter now has a usage string.	1	-2	 6138[0] commit[0] 3a6157d4ff42d4f765e118d704be5d59dd91e47b[0] several[0] changes[0] connected[0] with[0] adopting[0] the[0] task[0] package[0] into[0] ttools/tools[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] mostly[0] these[0] are[0] redesigns[0] of[0] features[0] that[0] i[0] didn't[0] like[0] the[0] look[0] of[0] when[0] i[0] came[0] to[0] look[0] at[0] it[0] again[0] a[0] couple[0] of[0] years[0] after[0] first[0] writing[0] task[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] main[0] things[0] are[0] environment[0] is[0] now[0] not[0] an[0] attribute[0] of[0] a[0] parameter[0] you[0] need[0] to[0] pass[0] an[0] environment[0] to[0] a[0] parameter[0] to[0] get[0] its[0] value[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] effect[0] will[0] usually[0] be[0] the[0] same[0] but[0] it[0] makes[0] explicit[0] the[0] fact[0] that[0] the[0] parameter[0] does[0] not[0] know[0] its[0] value[0] outside[0] of[0] an[0] execution[0] environment[0] of[0] some[0] kind[1][-1 LastWordBoosterStrength] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] environment[0] setparametervalue[0] and[0] clearparametervalue[0] have[0] been[0] renamed[0] to[0] acquirevalue[0] and[0] clearvalue[0] which[0] i[0] think[0] are[0] much[0] less[0] confusing[-1] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] thrown[0] exceptions[0] have[0] been[0] simplified[0] the[0] only[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] checked[0] exception[0] declared[0] by[0] an[0] interface[0] is[0] taskexception[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] parameter[0] now[0] has[0] a[0] usage[0] string[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-2 max of sentences]]]
