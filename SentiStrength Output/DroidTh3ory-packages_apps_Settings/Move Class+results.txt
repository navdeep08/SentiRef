5537 commit 436b29e68e6608bed9e8e7d54385b8f62d89208e refactor bluetooth settings for readability and performance. major refactoring of bluetooth settings classes. - moved all functionality from localbluetoothmanager into new localbluetoothadapter and localbluetoothpreferences, and into existing classes. - refactored functionality from bluetootheventredirector into new bluetootheventmanager class, deleting the original version. new version uses a hashmap from action strings to implementers of the bluetootheventmanager.handler interface. - created new bluetoothdiscoveryreceiver to update shared preferences timestamp for bluetooth discovery start/finish. this is the only event handling we need to do when the settings app is not visible, so it has its own receiver entry in androidmanifest.xml. edits are written using queuedwork.singlethreadexecutor(), which broadcastreceiver knows about and will wait for completion, eliminating the need for pendingresult. - miscellaneous cleanups to code style and logic for readability. - pulled some large switch statement code blocks into new methods. - changed all bluetooth state references to the new bluetoothprofile constants. - changed use of deprecated notification constructor in bluetoothpairingrequest to use notification.builder. - moved utf8bytelengthfilter helper function from bluetoothnamepreference into its own class, and moved test cases into the same package. - moved all localbluetoothprofilemanager functionality related to specific profiles into new top-level classes (a2dpprofile, etc.), all implementing the localbluetoothprofile interface. - moved all ui-related methods from cachedbluetoothdevice into the class that uses the method, or into the static utils class for shared methods. change-id: i6d49b7f4ae0c7d7dcf62551ee40b51ecb5fe4f47 	5537 commit 436b29e68e6608bed9e8e7d54385b8f62d89208e refactor bluetooth settings for readability and performance.<br> major refactoring of bluetooth settings classes.<br> -

7006 commit 0f4f2f3a81f2a6d7100b4cff0d8de062cb2bc8f6 fragmentize zonelist, which is needed in datetimesettings refactoring. - remove old zonepicker and rename zonelist to zonepicker, as the name is really confusing (see localepicker) - make the new zonepicker fragment. - remove dependency toward "zonelist" class. -- androidmanifest.xml does not allow the other components to access zonelist directly, so it would be ok to remove without using activity-alias. -- noticed there is a significant code duplication between datetimesettings and datetimesettingsactivity. i'll work on it later. - add datetimesettingssetupwizardxl class, which is not used yet, but will be in the near future. -- it is not recognized by androidmanifest.xml change-id: id26152a3d560f9e0bd84afdf3e1c5101f0e166b4 	7006 commit 0f4f2f3a81f2a6d7100b4cff0d8de062cb2bc8f6 fragmentize zonelist, which is needed in datetimesettings refactoring.<br> - remove old zonepicker and rename zonelist to zonepicker, as the name is really confusing (see localepicker) - make the new zonepicker fragment.<br> - remove dependency toward "zonelist" class.<br> - androidmanifest.<br>xml does not allow the other components to access zonelist directly, so it would be ok to remove without using activity-alias.<br> - noticed there is a significant code duplication between datetimesettings and datetimesettingsactivity.<br> i'll work on it later.<br> - add datetimesettingssetupwizardxl class, which is not used yet, but will be in the near future.<br> - it is not recognized by androidmanifest.<br>xml change-id: id26152a3d560f9e0bd84afdf3e1c5101f0e166b4	1	-3	 7006[0] commit[0] 0f4f2f3a81f2a6d7100b4cff0d8de062cb2bc8f6[0] fragmentize[0] zonelist[0] which[0] is[0] needed[0] in[0] datetimesettings[0] refactoring[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] remove[0] old[0] zonepicker[0] and[0] rename[0] zonelist[0] to[0] zonepicker[0] as[0] the[0] name[0] is[0] really[0] confusing[-1][-1 LastWordBoosterStrength] see[0] localepicker[0] make[0] the[0] new[0] zonepicker[0] fragment[0] [[Sentence=-3,1=word max, 1-5]] remove[0] dependency[0] toward[0] zonelist[0] class[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] androidmanifest[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] xml[0] does[0] not[0] allow[0] the[0] other[0] components[0] to[0] access[0] zonelist[0] directly[0] so[0] it[0] would[0] be[0] ok[0] to[0] remove[0] without[0] using[0] activity[0] alias[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] noticed[0] there[0] is[0] a[0] significant[0] code[0] duplication[0] between[0] datetimesettings[0] and[0] datetimesettingsactivity[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] i'll[0] work[0] on[0] it[0] later[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] add[0] datetimesettingssetupwizardxl[0] class[0] which[0] is[0] not[0] used[0] yet[0] but[0] will[0] be[0] in[0] the[0] near[0] future[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] it[0] is[0] not[0] recognized[0] by[0] androidmanifest[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] xml[0] change[0] id[0] id26152a3d560f9e0bd84afdf3e1c5101f0e166b4[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-3 max of sentences]]]
