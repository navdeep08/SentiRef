3267 commit 953df613522e12a418cb7cb73248594d6c9f53d4 refactor httpurlconnection implementation. break httpurlconnectionimpl into two parts: the part that implements the java api (that follows redirects etc.) and the part that speaks http. the http part is called httpengine, and it can only be used for a single http request. this makes it easier to set request properties that only apply to a single socket request. tests for 'vary', 'content-location' and warnings. for simplicity of implementation i've chosen not to support 'vary' at this time. the 'content-location' header doesn't require any work from the cache. warnings are ugly but allow the caller to identify when the cache results may be problematic. also breaking httpresponsecache's dependency on httpurlconnectionimpl so it can be tested on the ri. change-id: idbabb51251f479c2cdea4e0fceb029bfd07182be http://b/3180373 	3267 commit 953df613522e12a418cb7cb73248594d6c9f53d4 refactor httpurlconnection implementation.<br> break httpurlconnectionimpl into two parts: the part that implements the java api (that follows redirects etc.<br> and the part that speaks http.<br> the http part is called httpengine, and it can only be used for a single http request.<br> this makes it easier to set request properties that only apply to a single socket request.<br> tests for 'vary', 'content-location' and warnings.<br> for simplicity of implementation i've chosen not to support 'vary' at this time.<br> the 'content-location' header doesn't require any work from the cache.<br> warnings are ugly but allow the caller to identify when the cache results may be problematic.<br> also breaking httpresponsecache's dependency on httpurlconnectionimpl so it can be tested on the ri.<br> change-id: idbabb51251f479c2cdea4e0fceb029bfd07182be http://b/3180373	1	-3	 3267[0] commit[0] 953df613522e12a418cb7cb73248594d6c9f53d4[0] refactor[0] httpurlconnection[0] implementation[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] break[0] httpurlconnectionimpl[0] into[0] two[0] parts[0] the[0] part[0] that[0] implements[0] the[0] java[0] api[0] that[0] follows[0] redirects[0] etc[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] and[0] the[0] part[0] that[0] speaks[0] http[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] http[0] part[0] is[0] called[0] httpengine[0] and[0] it[0] can[0] only[0] be[0] used[0] for[0] a[0] single[0] http[0] request[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] makes[0] it[0] easier[0] to[0] set[0] request[0] properties[0] that[0] only[0] apply[0] to[0] a[0] single[0] socket[0] request[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] tests[0] for[0] 'vary'[0] 'content[0] location'[0] and[0] warnings[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] for[0] simplicity[0] of[0] implementation[0] i've[0] chosen[0] not[0] to[0] support[0] 'vary'[0] at[0] this[0] time[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] 'content[0] location'[0] header[0] doesn't[0] require[0] any[0] work[0] from[0] the[0] cache[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] warnings[0] are[0] ugly[-2] but[0] allow[0] the[0] caller[0] to[0] identify[0] when[0] the[0] cache[0] results[0] may[0] be[0] problematic[-1] [[Sentence=-3,1=word max, 1-5]] also[0] breaking[0] httpresponsecache's[0] dependency[0] on[0] httpurlconnectionimpl[0] so[0] it[0] can[0] be[0] tested[0] on[0] the[0] ri[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] idbabb51251f479c2cdea4e0fceb029bfd07182be[0] http[0] ://b/3180373[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-3 max of sentences]]]
