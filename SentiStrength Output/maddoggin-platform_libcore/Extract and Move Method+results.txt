4180 commit d3e311496e0b08acd959c3ffa31d9930a71bae19 improve the performance of reflective operations. common dex index lookups require a number of different types to be constructed, implement short-cuts that avoid the intermediate data types. refactor reflective operations to use dex methods that don't require temporary objects. note: this change adds an empty short array to dex, this code can't appear in libcore.util as dex doesn't always come with libcore.util. bug: 9968234 (cherry picked from commit 381db8de0ac5df124c7f482bf4be9d5756bf3ca4) change-id: i9122a3f01b4f41b07a84aff768193c092e29698c 	4180 commit d3e311496e0b08acd959c3ffa31d9930a71bae19 improve the performance of reflective operations.<br> common dex index lookups require a number of different types to be constructed, implement short-cuts that avoid the intermediate data types.<br> refactor reflective operations to use dex methods that don't require temporary objects.<br> note: this change adds an empty short array to dex, this code can't appear in libcore.<br>util as dex doesn't always come with libcore.<br>util.<br> bug: 9968234 (cherry picked from commit 381db8de0ac5df124c7f482bf4be9d5756bf3ca4) change-id: i9122a3f01b4f41b07a84aff768193c092e29698c	2	-2	 4180[0] commit[0] d3e311496e0b08acd959c3ffa31d9930a71bae19[0] improve[1] the[0] performance[0] of[0] reflective[0] operations[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] common[0] dex[0] index[0] lookups[0] require[0] a[0] number[0] of[0] different[0] types[0] to[0] be[0] constructed[0] implement[0] short[0] cuts[0] that[0] avoid[-1] the[0] intermediate[0] data[0] types[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] refactor[0] reflective[0] operations[0] to[0] use[0] dex[0] methods[0] that[0] don't[0] require[0] temporary[0] objects[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] note[0] this[0] change[0] adds[0] an[0] empty[0] short[0] array[0] to[0] dex[0] this[0] code[0] can't[0] appear[0] in[0] libcore[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] util[0] as[0] dex[0] doesn't[0] always[0] come[0] with[0] libcore[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] util[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] bug[0] 9968234[0] cherry[0] picked[0] from[0] commit[0] 381db8de0ac5df124c7f482bf4be9d5756bf3ca4[0] change[0] id[0] i9122a3f01b4f41b07a84aff768193c092e29698c[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-2 max of sentences]]]
