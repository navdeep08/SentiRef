9289 commit 4d61c8d57efcabd3f6eefdbbc325ce9905670e90 rfe 799865: add click() to image, etc. add support for click() for all element types that have an onclick attribute. this includes image. removed extra non-standard attributes (onclick, etc.) from bdo element. fixed support for button tags with type other than submit. added support for access keys to anchor, area, label, legend, and textarea elements. to simplify maintenance of javascript event handling, the keyboard and mouse related attributes were factored out to a common base class, clickableelement. the identity and stylee related attributes were factored out to styledelement. this removed a lot of redundant code from a lot of classes in the "html" package. the click handling was moved to the clickableelement base class which fixed a few latent bugs in some cases where the return code was not being handled properly, e.g., the button tag with a type other than submit. two test cases were updated so they check for standard operation. to add click support for lots of simple tags, e.g., b, em, code, etc., unknownhtmlelement was derived from clickableelement. but, this required unknowndomnode to be created to handle non-element nodes. the input derived classes were changed to take advantage of derivation instead of checking the type in base class methods. this is more efficient and more object-oriented. this also simplified the handling of click(x,y) for images. removed obsolete htmltabledata class and fixed comments in htmltablecell. added tests for additional button types and an extensive set of tests for clicking different element types. updated change log. 	9289 commit 4d61c8d57efcabd3f6eefdbbc325ce9905670e90 rfe 799865: add click( to image, etc.<br> add support for click( for all element types that
