9656 commit fa23a7b066e43068346b72df8a2739ba84c17a34 i2psnark: - refactor to allow running a single snark without a snarkmanager again, by moving some things from snarkmanager to i2psnarkutil, having snark call completelistener callbacks, and having storage call storagelistener callbacks. this is in preparation for using snark for router updates. step 2 is to allow multiple i2psnarkutil instances. - big rewrite of storage to open file descriptors on demand, and close them when unused, so we can support large numbers of torrents. 	9656 commit fa23a7b066e43068346b72df8a2739ba84c17a34 i2psnark: - refactor to allow running a single snark without a snarkmanager again, by moving some things from snarkmanager to i2psnarkutil, having snark call completelistener callbacks, and having storage call storagelistener callbacks.<br> this is in preparation for using snark for router updates.<br> step 2 is to allow multiple i2psnarkutil instances.<br> - big rewrite of storage to open file descriptors on demand, and close them when unused, so we can support large numbers of torrents.	1	-1	 9656[0] commit[0] fa23a7b066e43068346b72df8a2739ba84c17a34[0] i2psnark[0] refactor[0] to[0] allow[0] running[0] a[0] single[0] snark[0] without[0] a[0] snarkmanager[0] again[0] by[0] moving[0] some[0] things[0] from[0] snarkmanager[0] to[0] i2psnarkutil[0] having[0] snark[0] call[0] completelistener[0] callbacks[0] and[0] having[0] storage[0] call[0] storagelistener[0] callbacks[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] is[0] in[0] preparation[0] for[0] using[0] snark[0] for[0] router[0] updates[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] step[0] 2[0] is[0] to[0] allow[0] multiple[0] i2psnarkutil[0] instances[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] big[0] rewrite[0] of[0] storage[0] to[0] open[0] file[0] descriptors[0] on[0] demand[0] and[0] close[0] them[0] when[0] unused[0] so[0] we[0] can[0] support[0] large[0] numbers[0] of[0] torrents[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
10033 commit 4acd2996c56a39fc21aabd4fda85ee723be4c056 2007-07-14 complication * take the post-download routerinfo size check back out of reseedhandler, since it wasn't helpful, and a lower limit caused false warnings. * give eepget ability to enforce a min/max http response size. * enforce a maximum response size of 8 mb when reseedhandler downloads into a bytearrayoutputstream. * refactor reseedhandler/reseedrunner from static to ordinary classes, change invocation from routerconsolerunner accordingly. * add an eepget status listener to reseedhandler to log causes of reseed failure, provide status reports to indicate the progress of reseeding. * enable icon for default eepsite, and the index page of the router console (more later). 	10033 commit 4acd2996c56a39fc21abd4fda85ee723be4c056 2007-07-14 complication * take the post-download routerinfo size check back out of reseedhandler, since it wasn't helpful, and a lower limit caused false warnings.<br> * give eepget ability to enforce a min/max http response size.<br> * enforce a maximum response size of 8 mb when reseedhandler downloads into a bytearrayoutputstream.<br> * refactor reseedhandler/reseedrunner from static to ordinary classes, change invocation from routerconsolerunner accordingly.<br> * add an eepget status listener to reseedhandler to log causes of reseed failure, provide status reports to indicate the progress of reseeding.<br> * enable icon for default eepsite, and the index page of the router console (more later)	2	-2	 10033[0] commit[0] 4acd2996c56a39fc21aabd4fda85ee723be4c056/4acd2996c56a39fc21abd4fda85ee723be4c056[0] 2007[0] -07[0] -14[0] complication[-1] take[0] the[0] post[0] download[0] routerinfo[0] size[0] check[0] back[0] out[0] of[0] reseedhandler[0] since[0] it[0] wasn't[0] helpful[1] and[0] a[0] lower[0] limit[0] caused[0] false[0] warnings[0] [[Sentence=-2,2=word max, 1-5]] give[0] eepget[0] ability[0] to[0] enforce[-1] a[0] min/max[0] http[0] response[0] size[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] enforce[-1] a[0] maximum[0] response[0] size[0] of[0] 8[0] mb[0] when[0] reseedhandler[0] downloads[0] into[0] a[0] bytearrayoutputstream[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] refactor[0] reseedhandler/reseedrunner[0] from[0] static[0] to[0] ordinary[0] classes[0] change[0] invocation[0] from[0] routerconsolerunner[0] accordingly[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] add[0] an[0] eepget[0] status[0] listener[0] to[0] reseedhandler[0] to[0] log[0] causes[0] of[0] reseed[0] failure[0] provide[0] status[0] reports[0] to[0] indicate[0] the[0] progress[0] of[0] reseeding[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] enable[0] icon[0] for[0] default[-1] eepsite[0] and[0] the[0] index[0] page[0] of[0] the[0] router[0] console[0] more[0] later[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-2 max of sentences]]]
11236 commit b67b243ebd4f49e556aadeeb3f9c5c4e219751d9 the following isn't the end of the 0.4.1 updates, as there are still more things left to clean up and debug in the new tcp transport, but it all works, and i dont like having big changes sitting on my local machine (and there's no real need for branching atm) 2004-09-26 jrandom * complete rewrite of the tcp transport with ip autodetection and low cpu overhead reconnections. more concise connectivity errors are listed on the /oldconsole.jsp as well. the ip autodetection works by listening to the first person who tells you what your ip address is when you have not defined one yourself and you have no other tcp connections. * update to the i2np message format to add transparent verification at the i2np level (beyond standard tcp verification). * remove a potential weakness in our aesengine's safeencrypt and safedecrypt implementation (rather than verifying with e(h(key)), we now verify with e(h(iv))). * the above changes are not backwards compatible. * removed all of the old unused phttp code. * refactor various methods and clean up some javadoc. 	11236 commit b67b243ebd4f49e556adeeb3f9c5c4e219751d9 the following isn't the end of the 0.4.1 updates, as there are still more things left to clean up and debug in the new tcp transport, but it all works, and i dont like having big changes sitting on my local machine (and there's no real need for branching atm) 2004-09-26 jrandom * complete rewrite of the tcp transport with ip autodetection and low cpu overhead reconnections.<br> more concise connectivity errors are listed on the /oldconsole.<br>jsp as well.<br> the ip autodetection works by listening to the first person who tells you what your ip address is when you have not defined one yourself and you have no other tcp connections.<br> * update to the i2np message format to add transparent verification at the i2np level (beyond standard tcp verification)<br> * remove a potential weakness in our aesengine's safeencrypt and safedecrypt implementation (rather than verifying with e(h(key) we now verify with e(h(iv)<br> * the above changes are not backwards compatible.<br> * removed all of the old unused phttp code.<br> * refactor various methods and clean up some javadoc.	1	-2	 11236[0] commit[0] b67b243ebd4f49e556aadeeb3f9c5c4e219751d9/b67b243ebd4f49e556adeeb3f9c5c4e219751d9[0] the[0] following[0] isn't[0] the[0] end[0] of[0] the[0] 0[0] .4[0] .1[0] updates[0] as[0] there[0] are[0] still[0] more[0] things[0] left[0] to[0] clean[0] up[0] and[0] debug[0] in[0] the[0] new[0] tcp[0] transport[0] but[0] it[0] all[0] works[0] and[0] i[0] dont[0] like[0] having[0] big[0] changes[0] sitting[0] on[0] my[0] local[0] machine[0] and[0] there's[0] no[0] real[0] need[0] for[0] branching[0] atm[0] 2004[0] -09[0] -26[0] jrandom[0] complete[0] rewrite[0] of[0] the[0] tcp[0] transport[0] with[0] ip[0] autodetection[0] and[0] low[-1] cpu[0] overhead[0] reconnections[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] more[0] concise[0] connectivity[0] errors[0] are[0] listed[0] on[0] the[0] /oldconsole[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] jsp[0] as[0] well[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] ip[0] autodetection[0] works[0] by[0] listening[0] to[0] the[0] first[0] person[0] who[0] tells[0] you[0] what[0] your[0] ip[0] address[0] is[0] when[0] you[0] have[0] not[0] defined[0] one[0] yourself[0] and[0] you[0] have[0] no[0] other[0] tcp[0] connections[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] update[0] to[0] the[0] i2np[0] message[0] format[0] to[0] add[0] transparent[0] verification[0] at[0] the[0] i2np[0] level[0] beyond[0] standard[0] tcp[0] verification[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] remove[0] a[0] potential[0] weakness[-1] in[0] our[0] aesengine's[0] safeencrypt[0] and[0] safedecrypt[0] implementation[0] rather[0] than[0] verifying[0] with[0] e[0] h[0] key[0] we[0] now[0] verify[0] with[0] e[0] h[0] iv[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] above[0] changes[0] are[0] not[0] backwards[0] compatible[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] removed[0] all[0] of[0] the[0] old[0] unused[0] phttp[0] code[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] refactor[0] various[0] methods[0] and[0] clean[0] up[0] some[0] javadoc[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-2 max of sentences]]]
