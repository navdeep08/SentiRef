5217 commit f74298086446fb4a25456fe7e5f1d98b5433aa1d 1. refactoring of genoypewriters so that parallelization now works again with vcf4.0. we now have just a single reference to the old vcf classes, and that one will be purged soon. 2. moved jared's vcftool code into archive so that everything would compile. 3. added the vcf reference base (needed for indels) as an attribute to the variantcontext from the reader. 4. tribblermdtrackbuilderunittest was complaining that a validation file didn'r exist, so i commented it out. 	5217 commit f74298086446fb4a25456fe7e5f1d98b5433a1d 1.<br> refactoring of genoypewriters so that parallelization now works again with vcf4.0.<br> we now have just a single reference to the old vcf classes, and that one will be purged soon.<br> 2.<br> moved jared's vcftool code into archive so that everything would compile.<br> 3.<br> added the vcf reference base (needed for indels) as an attribute to the variantcontext from the reader.<br> 4.<br> tribblermdtrackbuilderunittest was complaining that a validation file didn'r exist, so i commented it out.	1	-2	 5217[0] commit[0] f74298086446fb4a25456fe7e5f1d98b5433aa1d/f74298086446fb4a25456fe7e5f1d98b5433a1d[0] 1[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] refactoring[0] of[0] genoypewriters[0] so[0] that[0] parallelization[0] now[0] works[0] again[0] with[0] vcf4[0] .0[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] we[0] now[0] have[0] just[0] a[0] single[0] reference[0] to[0] the[0] old[0] vcf[0] classes[0] and[0] that[0] one[0] will[0] be[0] purged[0] soon[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] 2[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] moved[0] jared's[0] vcftool[0] code[0] into[0] archive[0] so[0] that[0] everything[0] would[0] compile[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] 3[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] added[0] the[0] vcf[0] reference[0] base[0] needed[0] for[0] indels[0] as[0] an[0] attribute[0] to[0] the[0] variantcontext[0] from[0] the[0] reader[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] 4[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] tribblermdtrackbuilderunittest[0] was[0] complaining[-1] that[0] a[0] validation[0] file[0] didn'r[0] exist[0] so[0] i[0] commented[0] it[0] out[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-2 max of sentences]]]
