6776 commit 08f2214f1463c4efbc2be3439d7ad5f95cef9445 stage 1 of massive variation/genotype refactoring. this stage consists only of the code originating in the genotyper and flowing through to the genotype writers. i haven't finished refactoring the writers and haven't even touched the readers at all. the major changes here are that 1. variations which are backedbygenotypes are now correctly associated with those genotypes 2. genotypes which have an associated variation can actually be associated with it (and then return it when tovariation() is called). the only integration tests which need to be updated are msg-related (because the refactoring now made it easy for me to prevent msg from emitting tri-allelic sites). 	6776 commit 08f2214f1463c4efbc2be3439d7ad5f95cef9445 stage 1 of massive variation/genotype refactoring.<br> this stage consists only of the code originating in the genotyper and flowing through to the genotype writers.<br> i haven't finished refactoring the writers and haven't even touched the readers at all.<br> the major changes here are that 1.<br> variations which are backedbygenotypes are now correctly associated with those genotypes 2.<br> genotypes which have an associated variation can actually be associated with it (and then return it when tovariation( is called)<br> the only integration tests which need to be updated are msg-related (because the refactoring now made it easy for me to prevent msg from emitting tri-allelic sites)	1	-1	 6776[0] commit[0] 08f2214f1463c4efbc2be3439d7ad5f95cef9445[0] stage[0] 1[0] of[0] massive[0] variation/genotype[0] refactoring[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] stage[0] consists[0] only[0] of[0] the[0] code[0] originating[0] in[0] the[0] genotyper[0] and[0] flowing[0] through[0] to[0] the[0] genotype[0] writers[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] i[0] haven't[0] finished[0] refactoring[0] the[0] writers[0] and[0] haven't[0] even[0] touched[0] the[0] readers[0] at[0] all[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] major[0] changes[0] here[0] are[0] that[0] 1[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] variations[0] which[0] are[0] backedbygenotypes[0] are[0] now[0] correctly[0] associated[0] with[0] those[0] genotypes[0] 2[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] genotypes[0] which[0] have[0] an[0] associated[0] variation[0] can[0] actually[0] be[0] associated[0] with[0] it[0] and[0] then[0] return[0] it[0] when[0] tovariation[0] is[0] called[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] only[0] integration[0] tests[0] which[0] need[0] to[0] be[0] updated[0] are[0] msg[0] related[0] because[0] the[0] refactoring[0] now[0] made[0] it[0] easy[0] for[0] me[0] to[0] prevent[0] msg[0] from[0] emitting[0] tri[0] allelic[0] sites[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
