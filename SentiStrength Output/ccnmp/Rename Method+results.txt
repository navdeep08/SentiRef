581 commit bf37f43bfb0c50923205db05dd92e896e47035d2 refs #100626 implement very basic ui for setting properties for ccnr. added a sort of form interface for handling set values for ccnr_directory, ccnr_global_prefix, and ccnr_debug. all other properties are to be set by the config or env. needs a bit more cleanup. basic services work. we need more extensive test cases for the service to make sure it works well, or works well in a "long running" state (leave it one for a weekend and see if the service is still running). next commit will refactor in changes brought in by #100638. 	581 commit bf37f43bfb0c50923205db05dd92e896e47035d2 refs #100626 implement very basic ui for setting properties for ccnr.<br> added a sort of form interface for handling set values for ccnr_directory, ccnr_global_prefix, and ccnr_debug.<br> all other properties are to be set by the config or env.<br> needs a bit more cleanup.<br> basic services work.<br> we need more extensive test cases for the service to make sure it works well, or works well in a "long running" state (leave it one for a weekend and see if the service is still running)<br> next commit will refactor in changes brought in by #100638.	2	-1	 581[0] commit[0] bf37f43bfb0c50923205db05dd92e896e47035d2[0] refs[0] #100626[0] implement[0] very[0] basic[0] ui[0] for[0] setting[0] properties[0] for[0] ccnr[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] added[0] a[0] sort[0] of[0] form[0] interface[0] for[0] handling[0] set[0] values[1] for[0] ccnr_directory[0] ccnr_global_prefix[0] and[0] ccnr_debug[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] all[0] other[0] properties[0] are[0] to[0] be[0] set[0] by[0] the[0] config[0] or[0] env[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] needs[0] a[0] bit[0] more[0] cleanup[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] basic[0] services[0] work[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] we[0] need[0] more[0] extensive[0] test[0] cases[0] for[0] the[0] service[0] to[0] make[0] sure[0] it[0] works[0] well[0] or[0] works[0] well[0] in[0] a[0] long[0] running[0] state[0] leave[0] it[0] one[0] for[0] a[0] weekend[0] and[0] see[0] if[0] the[0] service[0] is[0] still[0] running[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] next[0] commit[0] will[0] refactor[0] in[0] changes[0] brought[0] in[0] by[0] #100638[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-1 max of sentences]]]
