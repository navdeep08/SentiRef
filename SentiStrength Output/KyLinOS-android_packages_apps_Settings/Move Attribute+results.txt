147 commit e6c3aeacdc6c41a3dd26f3e12899169d9ca0e0cb settings: improve qs tiles config code tile configuration has some unusual coding, like having a public static map (quicksettingsutil.tiles) to hold all tile information. that map is modified directly during the execution of quicksettings.oncreate(), which removes unavailable tiles from this global map. once those tiles are removed, they are gone for good (until the runtime decides that it must reinitialize quicksettingsutil.tiles). this patch tweaks this process a bit: - the global tiles variable is now immutable. - there is a distiction from disabling and removing a tile - removed tiles are those related to the device capabilities, and can never be enabled, once removed. - disabled tiles are those related to the device state, like the profiletile, which is unavailable if the user has disabled the profile feature. disabled tiles can be re-enabled later. - all code that actually removes/disables tiles is now at quicksettingsutil. the results of such operations are reflected on the tiles immutable view. - it is possible to enable tiles that have been disabled. this changes improve [citation needed] coding style a bit, but, furthermore, allows one to disable and reenable tiles when needed be. for instance, enabling profiles or expanded desktop will cause the corresponding tile to be available for selection immediately. that would not possible to accomplish, once those tiles were removed from the available tiles map. patch set 2: rebased patch set 3: rebase, refactor patch set 4: check network tile availability at every resume patch set 5: sort tiles at the adapter, revoke caveats patch set 6: some cleanup change-id: ifd46d81a49b0ce036e9ccd6d13b6e2251ecbf42a 	147 commit e6c3aeacdc6c41a3dd26f3e12899169d9ca0e0cb settings: improve qs tiles config code tile configuration has some unusual coding, like having a public static map (quicksettingsutil.<br>tiles) to hold all tile information.<br> that map is modified directly during the execution of quicksettings.<br>oncreate( which removes unavailable tiles from this global map.<br> once those tiles are removed, they are gone for good (until the runtime decides that it must reinitialize quicksettingsutil.<br>tiles)<br> this patch tweaks this process a bit: -

6309 commit 436b29e68e6608bed9e8e7d54385b8f62d89208e refactor bluetooth settings for readability and performance. major refactoring of bluetooth settings classes. - moved all functionality from localbluetoothmanager into new localbluetoothadapter and localbluetoothpreferences, and into existing classes. - refactored functionality from bluetootheventredirector into new bluetootheventmanager class, deleting the original version. new version uses a hashmap from action strings to implementers of the bluetootheventmanager.handler interface. - created new bluetoothdiscoveryreceiver to update shared preferences timestamp for bluetooth discovery start/finish. this is the only event handling we need to do when the settings app is not visible, so it has its own receiver entry in androidmanifest.xml. edits are written using queuedwork.singlethreadexecutor(), which broadcastreceiver knows about and will wait for completion, eliminating the need for pendingresult. - miscellaneous cleanups to code style and logic for readability. - pulled some large switch statement code blocks into new methods. - changed all bluetooth state references to the new bluetoothprofile constants. - changed use of deprecated notification constructor in bluetoothpairingrequest to use notification.builder. - moved utf8bytelengthfilter helper function from bluetoothnamepreference into its own class, and moved test cases into the same package. - moved all localbluetoothprofilemanager functionality related to specific profiles into new top-level classes (a2dpprofile, etc.), all implementing the localbluetoothprofile interface. - moved all ui-related methods from cachedbluetoothdevice into the class that uses the method, or into the static utils class for shared methods. change-id: i6d49b7f4ae0c7d7dcf62551ee40b51ecb5fe4f47 	6309 commit 436b29e68e6608bed9e8e7d54385b8f62d89208e refactor bluetooth settings for readability and performance.<br> major refactoring of bluetooth settings classes.<br> -
