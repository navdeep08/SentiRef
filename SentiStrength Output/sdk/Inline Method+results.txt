435 commit b681e01f17149c0ab1da96eabbc6d121e9e8b9d0 sdk manager: settings to control download cache. sdk manager   tools   options now has a checkbox to deactivate the download cache. it also indicates the path to the cache directory, its size and a button to clear the cache immediately. this only affects the sdk manager files for the download cache, it doesn't clear other cached files such as the lint binaries. also restructured the settings controller a tiny bit. there's more that could be restructured here but it's not a priority right now. change-id: i474e6155bdc041770f3f7664366d0d92bd96d9b0 	435 commit b681e01f17149c0ab1da96eabbc6d121e9e8b9d0 sdk manager: settings to control download cache.<br> sdk manager   tools   options now has a checkbox to deactivate the download cache.<br> it also indicates the path to the cache directory, its size and a button to clear the cache immediately.<br> this only affects the sdk manager files for the download cache, it doesn't clear other cached files such as the lint binaries.<br> also restructured the settings controller a tiny bit.<br> there's more that could be restructured here but it's not a priority right now.<br> change-id: i474e6155bdc041770f3f7664366d0d92bd96d9b0	1	-1	 435[0] commit[0] b681e01f17149c0ab1da96eabbc6d121e9e8b9d0[0] sdk[0] manager[0] settings[0] to[0] control[0] download[0] cache[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] sdk[0] manager[0] tools[0] options[0] now[0] has[0] a[0] checkbox[0] to[0] deactivate[0] the[0] download[0] cache[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] it[0] also[0] indicates[0] the[0] path[0] to[0] the[0] cache[0] directory[0] its[0] size[0] and[0] a[0] button[0] to[0] clear[0] the[0] cache[0] immediately[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] only[0] affects[0] the[0] sdk[0] manager[0] files[0] for[0] the[0] download[0] cache[0] it[0] doesn't[0] clear[0] other[0] cached[0] files[0] such[0] as[0] the[0] lint[0] binaries[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] also[0] restructured[0] the[0] settings[0] controller[0] a[0] tiny[0] bit[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] there's[0] more[0] that[0] could[0] be[0] restructured[0] here[0] but[0] it's[0] not[0] a[0] priority[0] right[0] now[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] i474e6155bdc041770f3f7664366d0d92bd96d9b0[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
