4045 commit 0757ce4af2764e4dd564acc0b1a013e910abc8da more refactoring work: convert hierarchy, and change type a lot of work on the "change layout" refactoring to improve conversion to a relative layout. first, add a "flatten hierarchy" option which can take an entire hierarchy of layout widgets and flatten it down to a single top level relativelayout where the constraints attempt to reflect the original layout. (this isn't always possible, since some layout managers offer features not possible to express in relativelayout, such as a linearlayout with multiple different weights) but it often works or is at least a good start. (this work is ongoing, but since my changeset is getting large i want to check in this snapshot since the functionality is better than what is in the trunk.) this changeset also adds a new refactoring: change widget type. this can be applied to a selection of elements, and it will convert the widget type to the new target widget type. it will also remove any attributes that are not valid for the new layout. it also improves the wizards which display the possible target types. for change widget type, it will first offer "related" widgets, so for an analogclock it will first offer digital clock, for a checkbox it will offer a checked text view and a radio button, etc. in addition, it will list views and layouts that it finds in any library jars (except for the builtin android ones), and any custom view classes in the project. there is also now some preliminary support for refactoring unit tests. these tests must be run as eclipse plugin tests, since they utilize the xml model (and the xml model cannot be mocked). the test infrastructure reads source xml files, applies the refactoring change list to them, and diffs the output with the known expected output (also stored as result xml files in the test project). finally, there are a number of fixes and improvements to the shared refactoring code. change-id: i0974653e530dfb4feb625e0eef8257c29d50614b 	4045 commit
