7419 commit 5013c9c13352b405a8c782500bdd968d204e6f27 refactor command thread creation logic into basecommand the thread creation is now optional, permitting dispatchcommand to not use it, while other subclasses do take advantage of it being available. error handling for the thread is now consistently handled in one spot, ensuring we get errors back in the client and in the log. signed-off-by: shawn o. pearce  sop@google.com  	7419 commit 5013c9c13352b405a8c782500bdd968d204e6f27 refactor command thread creation logic into basecommand the thread creation is now optional, permitting dispatchcommand to not use it, while other subclasses do take advantage of it being available.<br> error handling for the thread is now consistently handled in one spot, ensuring we get errors back in the client and in the log.<br> signed-off-by: shawn o.<br> pearce  sop@google.<br>com 	1	-1	 7419[0] commit[0] 5013c9c13352b405a8c782500bdd968d204e6f27[0] refactor[0] command[0] thread[0] creation[0] logic[0] into[0] basecommand[0] the[0] thread[0] creation[0] is[0] now[0] optional[0] permitting[0] dispatchcommand[0] to[0] not[0] use[0] it[0] while[0] other[0] subclasses[0] do[0] take[0] advantage[0] of[0] it[0] being[0] available[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] error[0] handling[0] for[0] the[0] thread[0] is[0] now[0] consistently[0] handled[0] in[0] one[0] spot[0] ensuring[0] we[0] get[0] errors[0] back[0] in[0] the[0] client[0] and[0] in[0] the[0] log[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] signed[0] off[0] by[0] shawn[0] o[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] pearce[0] sop@google[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
