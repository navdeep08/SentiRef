8323 commit 9a2a97d6aa5fb9dfaed1a0870e0bdaa38ff803a5 refactor the entire login panel to avoid reloading the module its significantly faster if the open id login panel is part of the same application, and simply inserts itself into the sign in dialog rather than loading through a separate html host page. we also now remember (at the user's option) the last openid url the user successfully logged in with, so it can be presented in future sign-in attempts. this helps in case the user forgets which provider they have used, or which account at that provider. signed-off-by: shawn o. pearce  sop@google.com  	8323 commit 9a2a97d6a5fb9dfaed1a0870e0bda38ff803a5 refactor the entire login panel to avoid reloading the module its significantly faster if the open id login panel is part of the same application, and simply inserts itself into the sign in dialog rather than loading through a separate html host page.<br> we also now remember (at the user's option) the last openid url the user successfully logged in with, so it can be presented in future sign-in attempts.<br> this helps in case the user forgets which provider they have used, or which account at that provider.<br> signed-off-by: shawn o.<br> pearce  sop@google.<br>com 	2	-2	 8323[0] commit[0] 9a2a97d6aa5fb9dfaed1a0870e0bdaa38ff803a5/9a2a97d6a5fb9dfaed1a0870e0bda38ff803a5[0][+0.6 MultipleLetters] refactor[0] the[0] entire[0] login[0] panel[0] to[0] avoid[-1] reloading[0] the[0] module[0] its[0] significantly[0] faster[0] if[0] the[0] open[0] id[0] login[0] panel[0] is[0] part[0] of[0] the[0] same[0] application[0] and[0] simply[0] inserts[0] itself[0] into[0] the[0] sign[0] in[0] dialog[0] rather[0] than[0] loading[0] through[0] a[0] separate[0] html[0] host[0] page[0] [[Sentence=-2,2=word max, 1-5]] we[0] also[0] now[0] remember[0] at[0] the[0] user's[0] option[0] the[0] last[0] openid[0] url[0] the[0] user[0] successfully[0] logged[0] in[0] with[0] so[0] it[0] can[0] be[0] presented[0] in[0] future[0] sign[0] in[0] attempts[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] this[0] helps[0] in[0] case[0] the[0] user[0] forgets[0] which[0] provider[0] they[0] have[0] used[0] or[0] which[0] account[0] at[0] that[0] provider[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] signed[0] off[0] by[0] shawn[0] o[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] pearce[0] sop@google[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-2 max of sentences]]]
