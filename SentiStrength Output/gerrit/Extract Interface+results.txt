5201 commit 8dba895ad6f4f3ed6254010cb879c2721d936406 refactor changehookrunner as an interface this enables deciding at startup time if hooks will be supported, and if not stub in a dummy implementation that does nothing. this is mainly useful for my gerrit-review.googlesource.com environment where the standard hook system of spawning an external program is not supportable. the factoring is a simple step towards a more pluggable event system. someone could implement a new version of changehooks that uses a guice multibinding to dispatch these events to multiple instances of the changehooks api. change-id: i6e9fba78f87d6e9ba8aaf80d386230334a492ea2 	5201 commit 8dba895ad6f4f3ed6254010cb879c2721d936406 refactor changehookrunner as an interface this enables deciding at startup time if hooks will be supported, and if not stub in a dummy implementation that does nothing.<br> this is mainly useful for my gerrit-review.<br>googlesource.<br>com environment where the standard hook system of spawning an external program is not supportable.<br> the factoring is a simple step towards a more pluggable event system.<br> someone could implement a new version of changehooks that uses a guice multibinding to dispatch these events to multiple instances of the changehooks api.<br> change-id: i6e9fba78f87d6e9ba8af80d386230334a492ea2	2	-1	 5201[0] commit[0] 8dba895ad6f4f3ed6254010cb879c2721d936406[0] refactor[0] changehookrunner[0] as[0] an[0] interface[0] this[0] enables[0] deciding[0] at[0] startup[0] time[0] if[0] hooks[0] will[0] be[0] supported[1] and[0] if[0] not[0] stub[0] in[0] a[0] dummy[0] implementation[0] that[0] does[0] nothing[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] this[0] is[0] mainly[0] useful[1] for[0] my[0] gerrit[0] review[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] googlesource[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] environment[0] where[0] the[0] standard[0] hook[0] system[0] of[0] spawning[0] an[0] external[0] program[0] is[0] not[0] supportable[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] the[0] factoring[0] is[0] a[0] simple[0] step[0] towards[0] a[0] more[0] pluggable[0] event[0] system[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] someone[0] could[0] implement[0] a[0] new[0] version[0] of[0] changehooks[0] that[0] uses[0] a[0] guice[0] multibinding[0] to[0] dispatch[0] these[0] events[0] to[0] multiple[0] instances[0] of[0] the[0] changehooks[0] api[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] i6e9fba78f87d6e9ba8aaf80d386230334a492ea2/i6e9fba78f87d6e9ba8af80d386230334a492ea2[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-1 max of sentences]]]
