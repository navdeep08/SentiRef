6978 commit 44671f5c6929a8f05223dd359182610286ceb98a rewrite our build as modular maven components this refactoring splits the code up into different components, with their own per-component classpath. by moving all of our classes into isolated components we can better isolate the classpaths and try to avoid unexpected dependency problems. it also allows us to more clearly define which components are used by the gwt ui and thus must be compiled under gwt, and which components are run on the server and can therefore use more of the j2se api. change-id: i833cc22bacc5655d1c9099ed7c2b0e0a5b08855a signed-off-by: shawn o. pearce  sop@google.com  	6978 commit 44671f5c6929a8f05223dd359182610286ceb98a rewrite our build as modular maven components this refactoring splits the code up into different components, with their own per-component classpath.<br> by moving all of our classes into isolated components we can better isolate the classpaths and try to avoid unexpected dependency problems.<br> it also allows us to more clearly define which components are used by the gwt ui and thus must be compiled under gwt, and which components are run on the server and can therefore use more of the j2se api.<br> change-id: i833cc22bacc5655d1c9099ed7c2b0e0a5b08855a signed-off-by: shawn o.<br> pearce  sop@google.<br>com 	1	-2	 6978[0] commit[0] 44671f5c6929a8f05223dd359182610286ceb98a[0] rewrite[0] our[0] build[0] as[0] modular[0] maven[0] components[0] this[0] refactoring[0] splits[0] the[0] code[0] up[0] into[0] different[0] components[0] with[0] their[0] own[0] per[0] component[0] classpath[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] by[0] moving[0] all[0] of[0] our[0] classes[0] into[0] isolated[-1] components[0] we[0] can[0] better[0] isolate[-1] the[0] classpaths[0] and[0] try[0] to[0] avoid[-1] unexpected[0] dependency[0] problems[-1] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] it[0] also[0] allows[0] us[0] to[0] more[0] clearly[0] define[0] which[0] components[0] are[0] used[0] by[0] the[0] gwt[0] ui[0] and[0] thus[0] must[0] be[0] compiled[0] under[0] gwt[0] and[0] which[0] components[0] are[0] run[0] on[0] the[0] server[0] and[0] can[0] therefore[0] use[0] more[0] of[0] the[0] j2se[0] api[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] i833cc22bacc5655d1c9099ed7c2b0e0a5b08855a[0] signed[0] off[0] by[0] shawn[0] o[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] pearce[0] sop@google[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] com[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-2 max of sentences]]]
