2210 commit e035784cd2ed946231452ea0a53db88d6c00a00c refactor success and createuser into sshutil to permit other forms of authentication to be performed, having the generic set-up of the user and verification in a common class allows this implementation to be called via alternative authentication methods. these changes have been migrated from databasepubkeyauth into sshutil, with the only changes being from the required signatures and a modification which doesn't require a key for the authentication or success stage. change-id: i59835e772d1f467ce5a49e8583064368cc3276b8 	2210 commit e035784cd2ed946231452ea0a53db88d6c00a00c refactor success and createuser into sshutil to permit other forms of authentication to be performed, having the generic set-up of the user and verification in a common class allows this implementation to be called via alternative authentication methods.<br> these changes have been migrated from databasepubkeyauth into sshutil, with the only changes being from the required signatures and a modification which doesn't require a key for the authentication or success stage.<br> change-id: i59835e772d1f467ce5a49e8583064368cc3276b8	1	-1	 2210[0] commit[0] e035784cd2ed946231452ea0a53db88d6c00a00c[0] refactor[0] success[0] and[0] createuser[0] into[0] sshutil[0] to[0] permit[0] other[0] forms[0] of[0] authentication[0] to[0] be[0] performed[0] having[0] the[0] generic[0] set[0] up[0] of[0] the[0] user[0] and[0] verification[0] in[0] a[0] common[0] class[0] allows[0] this[0] implementation[0] to[0] be[0] called[0] via[0] alternative[0] authentication[0] methods[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] these[0] changes[0] have[0] been[0] migrated[0] from[0] databasepubkeyauth[0] into[0] sshutil[0] with[0] the[0] only[0] changes[0] being[0] from[0] the[0] required[0] signatures[0] and[0] a[0] modification[0] which[0] doesn't[0] require[0] a[0] key[0] for[0] the[0] authentication[0] or[0] success[0] stage[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] change[0] id[0] i59835e772d1f467ce5a49e8583064368cc3276b8[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[1,-1 max of sentences]]]
